MACCONNELL:
  # This application was originally developed for a particular set of historical images known as the MacConnell set.
  # Some assumptions can be made due to what we know about this data that allows for specialized definitions in this
  # config file. If you are using this application for another purpose or on another set of images, set 'USE' to 'False'
  # and fill out 'OTHER'. Only one of 'MACCONNELL' or 'OTHER' needs to be filled out correctly.

    # The dimensions to scale the images to in preprocessing.

    # The free parameter in Harris Corner Detection. Must be in range 0.04-0.06. Larger values will increase precision
