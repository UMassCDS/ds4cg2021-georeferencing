MACCONNELL:
  # This application was originally developed for a particular set of historical images known as the MacConnell set.
  # Some assumptions can be made due to what we know about this data that allows for specialized definitions in this
  # config file. If you are using this application for another purpose or on another set of images, set 'USE' to 'False'
  # and fill out 'OTHER'. Only one of 'MACCONNELL' or 'OTHER' needs to be filled out correctly.

    # The dimensions to scale the images to in preprocessing.
    X_SCALE: 600
    Y_SCALE: 600
    # The RANSAC threshold. Larger numbers will make inliers more uniform and sparse

    # quality, or you want to detect larger corners.
    BLOCK_SIZE: 2
    # The size of the Sobel aperture kernel. Can only be 1, 3, 5, or 7. Larger values will bluir edges further before

    # The free parameter in Harris Corner Detection. Must be in range 0.04-0.06. Larger values will increase precision
    # (less false corners at the expense of missing out on more true corners as well). Smaller values increase recall
    # (miss less true corners at the expense of many more false corners)
